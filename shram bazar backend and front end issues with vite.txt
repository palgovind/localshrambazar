1.Action from vite for form submisson created the json object since vite has requested to
stringify formdata.
2. Since the /index returned index from backend without json data, now I am trying to
save data into database using /worker. By doing this the backend compiled to error
by saying that WorkerController does not have symbol method postWorker(Worker).So
we should write or access this method anyhow.But now I have used List<>findAll instead of postWorker

-->Typical Mistake (What You Are Likely Doing)
fetch("http://localhost:8080/api/data", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ id: 1 })   // ❌ NOT ALLOWED for GET
});


This will always fail in the browser.
-->Solution 2: Change the request to POST if you need a body

If you must send JSON data, use POST instead of GET.

Frontend
fetch("http://localhost:8080/api/data", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ id: 1 })
})
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));

Backend
@PostMapping("/api/data")
public ResponseEntity<String> postData(@RequestBody Map<String, Integer> payload) {
    return ResponseEntity.ok("Received id: " + payload.get("id"));
}


✔ Valid HTTP
✔ Works with JSON bodies
